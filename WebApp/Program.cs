         * TODO 8: Fix issue
         * Users complains that sometimes, when they call AccountController.UpdateAccount followed by
         * AccountController.GetByInternalId they get account with counter equals 0, like if UpdateCounter was never
         * called.
         *
         * It looks like as if there were two accounts, one being updated by UpdateAccount method and another does not.
         * 
         * This issue started happening at the same time when frontend team introduced major change in their frontend
         * architecture. Entire frontend split into independent widgets, each loading it state independently from API.
         * While this introduce lot of flexibility to frontend this also means multiple widgets call same API methods
         * simultaneously after login. As a result frontend JS code make number of simultaneous queries to
         * AccountController.Get right after login.
